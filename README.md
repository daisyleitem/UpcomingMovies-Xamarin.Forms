# Upcoming Movies Mobile App
(MOBILE DEV CODE CHALLENGE)

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
As a mobile engineer you've been tasked with the development of an app for cinephiles and movie
hobbyists. This first version (MVP) of the app will be very simple and limited to show the list of
upcoming movies. The app will be fed with content from The Movie Database (TMDb). No design specs
were given, so you're free to follow your UX and UI personal preferences. However the app should work
both in landscape and portrait orientations. The choice of platform (iOS, Android, Xamarin) and
development approach is also for you to decide based on previous experience and/or personal interest.
