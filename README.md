# Upcoming Movies Mobile App
(MOBILE DEV CODE CHALLENGE)

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
As a mobile engineer you've been tasked with the development of an app for cinephiles and movie
hobbyists. This first version (MVP) of the app will be very simple and limited to show the list of
upcoming movies. The app will be fed with content from The Movie Database (TMDb). No design specs
were given, so you're free to follow your UX and UI personal preferences. However the app should work
both in landscape and portrait orientations. The choice of platform (iOS, Android, Xamarin) and
development approach is also for you to decide based on previous experience and/or personal interest.

### PROJECT STATUS: INCOMPLETE
You can run it now in Visual Studio, without installing anything.
Until now was used only the [nuget package Newtonsoft.Json (12.0.2)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/)
(no introduce required) because today, it is one of the most popular and stable. 

It is necessary to evaluate and test a third-party solution very calmly to implement it, because, in the future,
you may have to do migrations. That's why I try to develop whenever possible with the native technology, 
even though this generates a more extensive and laborious code.

I had many problems with the Views design, as you can see in the pictures. I'm working on it.

Until now the project can be tested in platforms iOS, Android and UWP.
